# Advanced Usage

This chapter describes features that have emerged from special use cases. If you have a special data logging application that requires some additional features, please contact us so that it can be added to future versions of EasyGraph.

## Dose Mode

Dosing mode is a special mode selectable through the [Data logging](uiguide.md#data-logging) menu.

Dosing mode is designed for volume measurement of dosing shots. The volume value is automatically recorded and reset if the flowrate is steady and at zero for a certain duration.


The following data will be logged for each shot:


``` c
* "Shot no."
* "End-Volume [ml]" (Total)
* "Max. Î”p [bar]"
* "Max. Flowrate [ml/min]"
* "Time stamp"
* "Dose volume [+] [ml]"
* "Pullback volume [-] [ml]"

```

To make use of this mode, please note that the following application requirements are met:

- Hardware = Log.flow (preferred: analog version)
- Flowmeter connected to Input 1/master input

After enabling **Dosing Mode** additional settings appear:

**Zero flow tolerance**: Describes the absolute tolerance for the frequency/flowrate value that is interpreted as "zero flow"

**Reset behaviour**: Choose your intended volume reset behaviour. The two options are  `Reset on zero` and `Reset on first non-zero`.

**Zero flow duration:** Specifies the time that the flow has to be below zero tolerance in order to be considered as "zero flow" and consequently resets the volume

**Buffer status**: The buffer contains a history of samples to check whether the flow is below the specified zero tolerance for the whole duration. If the buffer is full, you can start dosing.

**Subtract last retract volume:** Last retract volume will be subtracted from end-volume and dose-volume. This can be enabled to log the positive dosing volume only.

!!! warning "Dose-Mode Excel-Files are export-only"
    The Excel-Files exported using **Dosing Mode** can ***not*** be re-imported into EasyGraph. You have to do all further processing and viewing in Excel.
