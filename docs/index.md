# What is EasyGraph? 

## Datalogging with log.flow and EasyGraph { data-search-exclude }
Log.flow can be used as an excellent data logging tool. Using the PC Software EasyGraph, highly dynamic processes can be analyzed with sampling rates up to 
1000 Hz. The flow rate and volume of both channels can be recorded simultaneously.

### Highlights { data-search-exclude }

- Perfect for quick diagnosis and analysis
- High-precision Frequency measurement and pulse counting
- GPU-accelerated live plots 
- Adjustable sampling rate sampling rate (1-1000 Hz) and filter levels
- Calculation functions for scaling the input values
- Data recording with trigger function
- Import/export of the recorded data
- Quick Creation of Excel/PDF reports for documentation
- Version Log.flow: 2x pulse input
- Version Log.flowV: 1x pulse input, 1x analog voltage input (0..10V)
- Version Log.flowI: 1x pulse input, 1x analog current input (0/4..20 mA)

### The log.flow device { data-search-exclude }

The Log.flow (VSE Art. no.: 4881) is an external USB Device that is attached to a PC to perform signal measurements and calculations of two attached flowmeters or other frequency-type sensors. Hardware specifications of the device can be found [here](logflow.md "Log.flow Device Description").
